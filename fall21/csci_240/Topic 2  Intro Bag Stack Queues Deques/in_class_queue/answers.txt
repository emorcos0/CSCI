1. Should I output to the terminal from inside my queue? Why?
    - No, you should not. Output to the terminal should be left to testing and the driver program. If the ADT doesn't call for it, do not include it. 

2. Should I frig around with the interface after it's been shared? Why?
    - No. Other people may be using the interface and may face issues and confusion when using the interface that has been altered by you.

3. Why did we have to change the variable "front" in both classes (arrayQueue and linkedQueue)?
    - Because there was already a function named front in both the derived classes and queue interface. This causes a linker error becuase there is a redeclaration of a previous identifier.
