Polymorphism: A variable of the base class can reference (point to) objects of the derived class.
              We can treat instances of the derived class as objects of the base class.

Data Structure: Collection of (encapsulation of) related data and operations that can be performed on them.

Dynamic Memory Allocation: Happens in the heap. 
                           Pros: Dynamic in size
                           Cons: Runtime overhead (management)
                                 No spacial locality - cache misses

Size of the stack: Not necessary to maintain its size since the stack is simple. It is processed until empty.
